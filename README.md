# 381 | Final-Project
## Coded by: Cody Jackson & Zachary Kruljac
Description: A grid based & turn based game that simulates the combat of Dungeons and Dragons (DnD) in a style similar to XCOM 2. A few (2-3) “scenarios” will be given starring different characters facing different enemies in different environments. Each player character can have a different class and abilities along with differing stats that determine the actions they can take during their turn of combat. Dice rolling will decide the outcome of most actions.

### Info

This project was coded in around 6 weeks for the "Game Engines" class at UNR. A majority of the project files can be found above, the library files have been excluded due to being to big (100gb), along with the cubemap files.

The game can be played here: https://play.unity.com/mg/other/381-d-d-command-hotfix

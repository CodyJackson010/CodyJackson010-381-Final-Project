# CodyJackson010-381-Final-Project
A grid based &amp; turn based game that simulates the combat of Dungeons and Dragons (DnD) in a style similar to XCOM 2. A few (2-3) “scenarios” will be given starring different characters facing different enemies in different environments. Each player character can have a different class and abilities along with differing stats that determine the actions they can take during their turn of combat. Dice rolling will decide the outcome of most actions.
